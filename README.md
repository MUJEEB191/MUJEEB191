# Hi there — I'm Mujeeb 👋

> A passionate developer with hands-on experience in web development and programming languages: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C (C Programming)** and experience working with various codebases. This repository is a living portfolio of learning projects, code snippets, and notes.

---

## 📚 Skills

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, Accessibility (a11y)
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS, DOM manipulation, ES6+ concepts
* **Backend / Scripting:** Python — scripting, automation, data processing
* **Systems / Low-level:** C Programming — algorithms, data structures
* **Other:** Version control with Git, basic debugging, writing clean and commented code

> ⚠️ Note: you mentioned `s code` — if you meant another language (e.g., **S** language, **SQL**, or **C#**), tell me and I'll update this README.

## 🚀 What you'll find in this repo

* `projects/` — small, focused projects (web pages, scripts, C programs)
* `snippets/` — handy code snippets and templates (HTML boilerplate, CSS utilities, JS helpers, Python snippets)
* `experiments/` — work-in-progress or learning experiments
* `notes/` — short explanations, tips, and commands (Git, debugging, compile/run instructions)

## 💡 Example quickstart

### Run a Python script

```bash
python3 scripts/example.py
```

### Open a simple web demo

1. Open `projects/web-demo/index.html` in your browser.
2. Or run a local server (recommended):

```bash
# Python 3 built-in server (serves current directory at http://localhost:8000)
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Compile & run a C program

```bash
gcc -o hello_c programs/hello.c
./hello_c
```

## 🧩 Project ideas (to include)

* **Personal Portfolio Website** — HTML/CSS/JS; responsive and accessible
* **To‑Do App** — JavaScript (localStorage) and simple UI interactions
* **Web Scraper / Automator** — Python script for small data collection or automation tasks
* **Algorithm Implementations** — C programs with classic algorithms and explanations

---

## 🧰 How I structure code

* Keep functions small and focused
* Add comments where the intent isn’t obvious
* Use `README.md` inside each project folder describing: purpose, how to run, and tech used
* Include license and contribution guidelines for larger projects

---

## 📫 Contact / Connect

* GitHub: `github.com/<your-username>`
* Email: `your.email@example.com`

If you want, I can:

* generate README badges (build, license, languages)
* create starter project folders for each skill
* or tailor the README to a specific job/role (internship, frontend, backend)
